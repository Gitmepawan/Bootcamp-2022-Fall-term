Create some custom functionality to show bio information for each team member (read
more button, or a lightbox / popover, a slider etc). Your creative coding choices to
implement this feature are entirely up to you.
However, you MAY NOT use jQuery or a 3rd party library. All code MUST be your own,
and MUST be native JavaScript.
Create some custom video controls for your app. The controls should match the
branding of your site; at a minimum, provide controls to toggle pause / play, rewind, and
volume.
Your bio information should be stored in an array or object and be dynamically added to
the page on some type of event (click, hover, etc) - refer to the Game of Thrones /
Dynamic Team Page projects for reference. Each team member is responsible
for adding their own bio information via Git workflow - a branch, push, pull request
and merge.
Create a Readme doc with agency branding; find / use a readme template and add the
appropriate information. This is an opportunity for you to establish your agencyâ€™s
personality - take advantage and do something interesting.
